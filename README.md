# Texture-Design
You can set the outside faces by changing the pngs called top, bottom, right, left, back and front.
Each pixel needs to be black or white, and some of the dimensions need to match up (you can see in the example which dimensions need to be the same provided in this repository)
The minimum size can be 3x3x3
To run you need to run main. The first time running it, it would take a couple of seconds, subsequent runs will be faster.
You will get as output in the folder the code is in the grids, one grid for each layer from back to front with the variation on the square written and shown.
the front right top cube can't always be set to fit the predetermined faces.
